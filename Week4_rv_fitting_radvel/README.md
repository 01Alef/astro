    1. Write down everything you know about how exoplanets are detected and characterized. What is confusing or unclear? What questions do you still have?
    
### Discussion:
1. Sarah: Exoplanet Detection and Orbit-fitting.

### Paper of the Week:
[Whistling Vivaldi](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mNisjq1yZL2pIpoysNbK3xCAfuZrtX-Q). 

Although we would like to think of science as purely logical, it is impossible to separate the science being done from the scientist who is doing it. Next week, we will have a discussion about identity, equity, and inclusion in the context of astronomy research. Please read this excellent summary of stereotype threat to prepare. Astronomy is not equally accessible to everyone. Let's change that!

# Assignments:

1. Check your work from last week against the tutorial answer keys (posted in week 3 folder)
2. Read Whistling Vivaldi article (see above) about stereotype threat. Be prepared to discuss this reading in-class next week.
3. Complete Ruben's & Sarah's RadVel tutorial.
