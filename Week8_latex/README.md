For further tutorials and examples, see the many fantastic guides at https://www.overleaf.com/learn, and of course the [Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort-letter.pdf) (a copy also lives in this folder).

Assignment: If you haven't already, write your CV in LaTeX to take it to the next level. Check out
the many CV templates at https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv. You can also Google around for
templates others have scattered across the internet.

Additionally, select a template to use for your final project writeup. Some great examples can be
found here:

* https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/research-proposal
    
and also the official AAS journal artical template

* https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/aas

Of course, feel free to modify these and/or create your own!
